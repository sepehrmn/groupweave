# NEAR Smart Contracts (Under Audit)

> **Status â€” October 6, 2025:** All production contract code now resides in the private DreamWeave repository for a comprehensive third-party security audit.

The staking, voting, and ZKP verifier contracts previously tracked in `apps/contracts` were migrated to DreamWeave alongside the merged web experience. This directory remains as a placeholder until the audit report is finalized and the hardened implementations are cleared for re-release.

What to expect next:
- Sanitized reference contracts, deployment scripts, and audit notes will be restored here after remediation is complete.
- Issue tracking for contract features remains open, but pull requests should focus on documentation or tooling updates that do not expose private code.
- We will publish migration guidance for node operators and integrators ahead of the public relaunch.

Thank you for your patience while we certify the contracts for mainnet use.
