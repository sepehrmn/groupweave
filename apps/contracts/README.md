## Bounty Prediction Market Contract

This contract manages bounties, staking on bounty options, and reward distribution. It combines the functionalities of staking and prediction markets into a single, efficient contract.

### Key Features:
- **Bounty Creation**: Users can create bounties with a title, description, multiple options, a maximum stake amount per user, and a duration.
- **Staking on Options**: Users can stake NEAR tokens on the bounty option they predict will win.
- **Reward Distribution**: When a bounty is closed, the contract determines the winning option based on the total stake for each option. The prize pool (total staked amount minus a platform fee) is distributed proportionally among the users who staked on the winning option.
- **Owner Controls**: The contract owner can manage the platform fee rate, maximum stake amounts, and pause the contract in case of emergencies.
- **Migration Support**: The contract includes a migration function to handle state transitions during upgrades.
