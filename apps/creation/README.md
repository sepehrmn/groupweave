# Creation App (Placeholder)

> **Status â€” October 6, 2025:** Active development of the GroupWeave creation surface now lives in the private DreamWeave monorepo while a security audit is underway.

The former `apps/creation` Next.js project has been merged into the consolidated DreamWeave web experience that also serves dashboard and participation flows. The audited implementation will be re-synced to this repository once the review closes and the public launch plan is finalized.

In the meantime:
- Do not attempt to run, build, or deploy this workspace; the source is intentionally absent.
- Track updates in this repository's main `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` files for re-opening milestones.
- Submit documentation or tooling suggestions via issues or pull requests that do not rely on private DreamWeave code.

Thank you for your patience while we harden the next release.
