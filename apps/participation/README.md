# Participation App (Placeholder)

> **Status â€” October 6, 2025:** Participation flows are part of the unified DreamWeave web experience that is currently undergoing audit.

This directory previously hosted a standalone Next.js app. It now acts as a placeholder while the merged DreamWeave experience (covering creation, dashboard, and participation journeys) is reviewed. Once the audit wraps and launch artifacts are finalized, we will publish an updated, open-source version here.

For now:
- Do not run, build, or expect source code inside this workspace.
- Follow repository announcements for the reopen timeline.
- Share documentation or tooling feedback through issues and PRs that do not require the private DreamWeave codebase.

Thanks for helping us ship a hardened release.
