# Documentation App (On Hold)

> **Status â€” October 6, 2025:** The public documentation experience is being rebuilt alongside the DreamWeave consolidation and will return here after the ongoing security audit.

While the creation, dashboard, and participation apps now live as a merged DreamWeave surface, the docs site is being updated to match the new architecture. This workspace intentionally ships without runnable code until the audited release is ready.

In the interim:
- Use the central `docs.json` + `generate_docs.py` flow in this repository for documentation changes.
- Avoid attempting to run Next.js commands from this directory.
- Track repository announcements for the refreshed documentation portal timeline.

Community contributions to shared docs and tooling remain welcome.
