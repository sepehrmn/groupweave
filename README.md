# GroupWeave

AI video generation is advancing at an incredible pace, leading to a significant shift in content creation and consumption.

GroupWeave is the open-source infrastructure for user-owned AI, designed to enable co-creation and co-immersion in generative AI content. Currently developing on NEAR, with plans to integrate Shade agents as customizable, semi-autonomous assistants for multimodal content understanding, moderation, and curation.

Work is being transferred from private repos.
