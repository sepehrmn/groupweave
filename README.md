# GroupWeave

AI content generation is advancing at an incredible pace, leading to a significant shift in content creation and consumption.

GroupWeave is the open-source infrastructure for user-owned AI, designed to enable co-creation and co-immersion in generative AI content. Currently developing on NEAR, with plans to integrate Shade agents as customizable, semi-autonomous assistants for multimodal content understanding, moderation, and curation.

Work is being transferred from private repos.

## Developer Contributions

Please fork the repository, then create a branch and make the changes you wish to propose. Finally, make a pull request and submit for review. Code contributors have to be approved by the maintainer(s)â€”one at this time and two when the project has grown. 

## Roadmap

The following features are currently being developed:

*   Betting as a mechanism for content curation/moderation with reward and punishment
*   Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)
*   User-owned AI and personalization
